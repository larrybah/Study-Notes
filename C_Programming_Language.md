# The C Programmming Language

C is one of the oldest programming languages *some consider it to be the mother of all programming languages*.
It is an **Imperative** **Procedural** typed language.

**Imperative** means it is has a clearly defined sequence of instructions in a program.
**Procedural** means it divides tasks a program is suppose to do into smaller sub-tasks.

## Data Type and Symbols

| Data Type | Symbol | Size in bytes | Definition |
| ------ | ------| ------ | ------ |
| int | i, d or %i, %d | 2 or 4 | Intergers are whole numbers that can have both zero, positive and negative values but no decimal values, also sometimes called signed integers. eg **0, -5, 10 .** 
| double | lf or %lf | 8 | holds real numbers. eg **34.564e2.** 
| char | c or %c | 1 | character type
| float | f or %f | 4 | holds real numbers. eg **25.342e2.**
| short int | hd or %hd | 2 | 
| unsigned int | u or %u | 2 or 4 | type modifiers, You can  alter the data storage of a data type by using them. **unsigned -** allows for storage of only positive numbers. 
| long int | ld, li or %ld, %li | 4 or 8 |
| long long int | lld, lli or %lld, %lli | 8 |
| unsigned long int | lu or %lu | 4 |
| unsigned long long int | llu or %llu | 8 |
| signed char | c or %c | 1 |
| unsigned char | c or %c | 1 |
| long double | LF or %LF | 10 or 16 |

### Derived Data Types
Data types that are derived from fundamental data types are derived types. Eg, **arrays, pointers, function types, structures, bool type, Enumerated type, Complex types.**
