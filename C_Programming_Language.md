# The C Programmming Language

C is one of the oldest programming languages *some consider it to be the mother of all programming languages*.
It is an **Imperative** **Procedural** typed language.

**Imperative** means it is has a clearly defined sequence of instructions in a program.
**Procedural** means it divides tasks a program is suppose to do into smaller sub-tasks.
