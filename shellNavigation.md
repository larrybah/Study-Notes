# Linux And Shell Navigation Notes

Like windows all unix-like Operating Systems are structured in a hirachical order.

One of the most important differences between windows and unix-like Operating systems such as Linux is that linux does not employ the concept of drive letters. while windows drive letters split the file systems into a series of different trees (one letter for each drive/device), linux always has a single tree. Different storage devices may be different branches of the tree, but there is always just a single tree.

- pwd - present working directory.
- cd - current working directory.
- ls - list directories

## ls 

The `ls` Command is used to list the contents of a directory, It is probably the most used linux commmand.

It can be used in different ways.

| list type | meaning |
| ----- | ---------- |
| ls | list the files in the working directory  |
| ls /bin | list the files in the /bin directory |
